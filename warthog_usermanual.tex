\pagebreak[4]
\subsubsection{Battery Charger}
Please see Appendix for information about the provided charger.

\subsubsection{Bilge Pumps}\label{bilgepumps}
The Warthog has two bilge pumps, with one situated in each of the drive units underneath the motor.

The bilge pumps are used to remove water from the main chassis and drive units during operation in water. At initial startup, an audible sound can be heard from the bilge pumps being initiated. These pumps are an automatic pumping system that check for water levels inside the drive units. The pumps automatically come on every two minutes and check for water levels. If the water level inside the drive unit exceeds a predetermined level, the pumps will remain on, otherwise they will shut off. During prolonged use in water, some water may appear in the drive unit. This is normal and acceptable.

%% Picture of bilge pumps

This outlet leads from the pump to the exterior of the Warthog. It is used to remove excess water from the chassis and drive units. No obstructions should be placed in front of or around this area. Obstruction of water flow may result in damage to the internal electrical components and loss of function in the Warthog.

\subsubsection{User Panel}\label{userarea}

The User Panel provides access to the user power panel, as well as USB, serial, and ethernet ports.  The power panel can be used to power your payloads. The USB 3.0 and ethernet  ports are connected directly to the onboard PC. To connect a device to the onboard network, it's suggested to give it a static IP in the \lstinline{192.168.131.x} subnet, avoiding IPs in use by the following pre-existing devices:

\section{Getting Started}

The first step is to read this manual and safety warnings.  The next step is to power up your Warthog and have some fun driving it around!

Twist the red power button on the back of Warthog. Once the body lights are flashing red, twist (to reset) all four stop buttons (if necessary), and press go on the Wireless Stop Remote (next section). In a moment, Warthog should go to solid red lights in back, and solid white in front.

\subsection{Wireless Stop Remote}

Included with the Warthog is a wireless stop remote, shown in Figure \autoref{wireless-stop} below, which is needed for operation.  If the wireless stop remote is out of range (~900m), it will cause the system to stop.
Likewise, if the wireless stop remote is inactive for 15 minutes, it will cause the system to stop.

To turn on the remote, hold down the red 'POWER' button until the battery and signal strength flash.
The vehicle's lights will give an indication of the state of the stop system.

To assert a stop during operation, simply press the 'Stop' button which will be verified by the Warthog's lights flashing red.  Similarly, to release the stop system to resume operation, press 'Stop' followed by 'GO'.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{wireless-stop-remote.png}
  \caption{Warthog's Wireless Stop Remote}
  \label{wireless-stop}
\end{figure}


If you’re not seeing any change in behaviour, please contact our support team.

\subsection{Futaba Controller}

The long range remote control (RC) Futaba radio transmitter can be used to tele-operate the Warthog.
To begin, slide the power switch to the ON position which is labelled in Figure \autoref{fubata}.

\begin{warning}[]
Caution: The speed adjustment knob should be turned initially all the way to the left while familiarizing yourself with the transmitter and slowly increasing it to get it moving.
\end{warning}

The position of the speed adjustment scale is shown in \autoref{futaba-screen} as 'CH4'.
The transmitter needs to be enabled which is done using the Deadman switch.  The deadman switch is a two position spring loaded switch.  To enable the RC tele-operation, the switch needs to be held down.  If released, the switch returns to the up position to disable the robot.

The left joy stick is used for the forward and reverse motion of the robot and the right joystick is used for turning.

\subsection{Body Lights}

Warthog includes four RGB body lights, stacked in a pair on each corner of the chassis. These lights express system status according to \autoref{bodylights}, but in the absence of one of the low-level conditions, they can be commanded from ROS to display indications from autonomy or other higher-level software.

See \url{http://wiki.ros.org/warthog_base} for information on commanding the body lights.

\def\arraystretch{1.2}%
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{>{\columncolor{lightgrey}}>{\raggedright}m{.25\textwidth} p{.7\textwidth}} \hline

  Solid red & The MCU is not in contact with the computer. That is, the rosserial connection is not active. This condition will be seen briefly on startup while Warthog's computer is booting up. If it persists, or is seen after initialization, either the base node on the PC has crashed, the network switch has failed, or a serious MCU error has occurred. If you suspect one of these conditions, please contact our support team. \\ \hline

  Red flashing & Stop circuit is broken. Twist the mushroom buttons to ensure that they are unlatched, and check any external stop hardware, if present. \\ \hline

  Flashing yellow & Motor drivers not yet ready to drive. The motors have a brief initialization sequence which must complete after a stop condition clears before they are ready to drive. If this condition persists, please contact our support team. \\ \hline

  Headlights/taillights & When Warthog is ready to drive, the front will change from red to white. The intensity of the head and tail lights will increase slightly when actually in motion. This is the status which may be overridden by publishing your own light patterns to the cmd\_lights ROS topic. \\ \hline

\pagebreak[4]


\subsection{Wireless Access}

To get Warthog connected to your local wifi, you must first access the internal computer using a wired connection. Connect to one of the the network ports with a standard ethernet cable. Now, set your laptop’s ethernet port to a static IP such as \lstinline{192.168.131.51}, and connect via SSH to \lstinline{administrator@192.168.131.1}. The default password is \lstinline{clearpath}.

Once connected via wire, execute \lstinline{connmanctl} to enter the command line interface for Connman, from which you can configure Warthog to either join an existing network, or supply its own standalone access point. An example session to connect to an existing network:

\begin{lstlisting}
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_123456_123456789123456789_managed_psk
\end{lstlisting}

After the \lstinline{connect} line, connman will prompt you for your network's passphrase. Once connected, connman will remember and attempt to reconnect on successive power-ons.


\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Remote ROS Connectivity}

Now that Warthog is on the wireless network, you can access it via SSH or as a remote ROS master. Note that in the default configuration, the background ROS process running on Warthog launches with the \lstinline{robot_upstart} package, which is configured to set the \lstinline{ROS_HOSTNAME} environment variable to the Warthog PC's hostname.

If your network resolves hostnames properly, connecting should be a matter of executing the following two lines in your desktop (or sourcing a script containing these lines):

\begin{lstlisting}
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://cpr-warthog:11311     # Your robot's hostname
export ROS_IP=192.168.131.1                        # Your computer's wireless IP address
\end{lstlisting}

If your network doesn't resolve hostnames, you may need to add the following line to your \lstinline{/etc/hosts} file:

\begin{lstlisting}
192.168.131.1 cpr-warthog                         # The robot's wireless IP address.
\end{lstlisting}

Once everything is set up correctly, try running \lstinline{rostopic list}, which will verify that your machine can see the robot's ROS master, and \lstinline{rostopic echo /mcu/status}, which will verify that the robot PC can see your machine in order to stream topics to it.

Please contact Clearpath Support if guidance is required in selecting and executing a remote access strategy.

\url{http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup}

\subsection{Visualizing Warthog}

To command or observe Warthog from your desktop computer, first set up a basic ROS installation.  See the following page for details:

\url{http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu}

When your ROS install is set up, install the Warthog desktop packages:

\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-warthog-desktop
\end{lstlisting}

Once your remote access to Warthog's ROS master is configured (as above), you can launch rviz, the standard ROS robot visualization tool:

\begin{lstlisting}
roslaunch warthog_viz view_robot.launch
\end{lstlisting}

From within rviz, you can use interactive markers to drive Warthog, you can visualize its published localization estimate, and you can visualize any attached sensors which have been added to its robot description XML (URDF).

\pagebreak[4]

From your desktop, you can also launch the standard RQT Robot Monitor, which reports the diagnostic output from Warthog's self-monitoring capabilities, as shown in \autoref{robotmonitor}:

\begin{lstlisting}
rosrun rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{rqt_robot_monitor.png}
  \caption{Robot Monitor}
  \label{robotmonitor}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Drive Train}

The Warthog has the ability to be put into neutral which is controlled be the four levers (two per side) in the rockers.  The lever can be seen in \autoref{lever}.  Use the bolts to restrict the lever from moving as down in \autoref{drivetrain-n} where the drivetrain is in neutral.  The grove for the neutral position is marked with white and the bolt is also marked.  Pull the handle on the lever to move it into gear which can be seen in \autoref{drivetrain-g}.  Ensure the lever is in the green grove.  If the lever is difficult to move, rock the Warthog back and forth.  Do not try to force the lever to move.

\section{Safety Considerations}

Warthog is a powerful, heavy, fast moving robotic platform. Please read the following safety information carefully.

\subsection{General Warnings}

For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with the motors not engaged.  Whenever the robot is not being operated and the motors are engaged, keep it in a stop state.  Do not ride on the vehicle, it can accelerate and brake quickly.

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds. Warthog's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low as 0.1 m/s. Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don’t go quite as you expect.

When enabling the system using the GO button on the wireless remote, be sure to stand well back from the Warthog. User code running on the Warthog may still be trying to command the motors, and this can result in sudden and unexpected movement of the vehicle. Be prepared to stop the system again using the wireless remote.


\subsection{Maneuverability in Water}

Before entering the water it is important to ensure that:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
  \item Bilge pumps are functioning properly.  See Bilge Pump section on page \pageref{bilgepumps} for more information.
  \item The side panels and top cover are properly fastened down
  \item All access panels are fastened down
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Pinch Points}

When operating the Warthog  it is important to maintain a safe distance away from the unit. The suspension seen in \autoref{pinchpoints} has the ability to pivot.  Do not place fingers anywhere along the suspension link as it can result in injury.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Warthog_pinch_points.jpg}
  \caption{Warthog Pinch Points}
  \label{pinchpoints}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Stop Buttons}

The Stop system on the Warthog has two major components: The hardwired Stop switches and the wireless stop remote.

\subsubsection{Hardwired Stop}

Pressing down one of the 4 red mushroom Stop buttons around the Warthog will disable power to the SEVCON devices (Key switch input on PIN 1). This disables the large contactors and also enables the brakes (passive, spring activated when not powered). The status indicator lights around the Warthog will flash red.

To reset a Stop button, the top of the button should be twisted until the button pops out again. The GO button on Wireless remote must then pressed. The Warthog is fully enabled once a relay click is heard, and the front lights change to white.

\subsubsection{Wireless Remote Stop}

To operate the Warthog, the wireless remote stop also has to be powered on (by holding the Power button for at least 1 second). The remote Stop button toggles the Stop status, so it must be pressed once to enable Stop, and pressed again to return to an Stop reset ready state, much like the hardwired Stop buttons. The GO button on the remote will then reset the stop condition. The wireless remote will shut itself off after 15 minutes of inactivity. Thus, the user is suggested to toggle the reset button (or either AUX 1 or 2) every few minutes to keep the remote awake. This is done to ensure that the user does not forget about the wireless remote, leading to a safety hazard.

Always ensure the Stop button is accessible at all times. Avoid mounting payloads that extend over the rear of Warthog and would occlude the Stop buttons.

\subsection{Electrical System}

The largest electrical safety consideration with the Warthog system is the VBat connection. As it is pulled straight from the batteries, it may have a voltage of 48V (depleted) - 62V (Charging) and can be used to power large external devices. This voltage can cause electrical shock if directly contacted, and is fused internally with an inline fuse at 10A. In general, take care to connect or disconnect devices preferably only when the entire system is powered off via the external switch on the rear (main power switch).

Take note that triggering a Stop condition only disables voltage to the SEVCON drivers and motors, not the rest of the system which includes the connectors.

The labelled status LEDS on the user panels indicate status of the system voltages. If an LED is not lit, most likely a system fuse has blown, and contacting Clearpath support is the best option.

To ensure saftey, please also observe the following precautions:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
  \item Do not tamper with the battery terminals or wiring.
  \item Consult Clearpath Robotics support if you need to service the battery pack.
  \item Do not lay tools or other objects on top of the battery.
  \item Do not move the robot while charging the battery.
  \item Charge the battery only with the charger provided by Clearpath Robotics.
  \item Please dispose of the batteries properly, or return the batteries to Clearpath Robotics to do so.
\end{itemize}


\section{Payload Integration Guide}

If you want to attach custom hardware to Warthog, you will have to take care of mechnical mounting, electrical supply, and software integration.  This section aims to equip you with respect to these challenges.

\subsection{System Architecture}

Like most robotic systems, Warthog has an onboard PC coupled to a custom microcontroller board. The microcontroller board handles IO, system and battery monitoring, and provides an interface to the CAN-controlled motor drivers. See the diagram in \autoref{systemarchitecture} for more details.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{warthog-logic-conn.pdf}
  \caption{System Architecture}
  \label{systemarchitecture}
\end{figure}

Using ROS to interface with the Warthog, the ROS API described in \autoref{tab:rosapi} can be used and the node connections can be seen in \autoref{fig:rqt-graph}

\subsection{Mechanical Mounting}
\label{mechanical}

The payload integration area can be used to mount external payloads on top of the Warthog.


\subsubsection{Payload Integration Guidelines}

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]

\item 27.75” is the maximum allowed width of any installed payload (this assumes that the payload is also centered across the width of the UGV chassis.

\item  No part of the payload may extend over the sheet metal housings of the drive units or into the small (~2”) gaps between the chassis and drive units. Damage to both the UGV and the payload WILL result.

\item  The chassis has a removable access cover measuring ~46.25” x 26.25”. This access cover is supported underneath by two adjustable cross members. Regardless of payload, it is imperative that both cross members remain installed (approximately evenly spaced) to provided required support to the access cover. Consider that any payload installed above the top deck will prevent access to the chassis through the access cover, without first removing the installed payload.

\item  The rotation of the suspension differential link in the horizontal plane will allow the payload to extend beyond the chassis top deck in both fore and aft locations. The amount of this payload extension (overhang) is dependent on several factors, including the weight and method of attachment of the payload as well as the terrain in which the UGV will operate. Ensure that the amount of overhanging payload allows the UGV to operate safely and does not contact the terrain, especially when crossing steep and/or deep gullies.

\item  The available internal chassis volume is approximately 17.5” long x 26” wide x 9.5” high. This space is located at the center of the chassis between two battery packs. Consider that anything placed inside the chassis MUST be secured as to not move or shift during UGV operation. Any payload secured inside the chassis must also be insulated from coming into contact with the battery wiring and terminals.

\end{itemize}




\begin{warning}[]
Permanent damage resulting from custom modifications to the mounting plate is not covered under warranty and may not be supported by Clearpath Support.  Please contact our support team if you require assistance or have any questions relating to custom modifications.
\end{warning}


\pagebreak[4]
\subsection{Electrical Integration}
\label{electrical}

The user power receptacles located in the User Panel are capable of supplying 5Vdc, 12Vdc, and unregulated battery voltage (approximately 48Vdc) for powering Warthog's payloads. See \autoref{userpower} for an labeled illustration and \autoref{userpowerpinout} the pin assignments. Ensure you select contact appropriate for the gauge of wire used.

The electrical system for the chassis can be seen in \autoref{elec-chassis}. Additionally, left and right drive units electrical system is decribed in \autoref{elec-left} and \autoref{elec-right} respectivelty.

\subsection{Software Integration}

ROS has a large ecosystem of sensor drivers, some of which include pre-made URDF description and even simulation configurations.  Please see the following page on the ROS wiki for a partial list:

\url{http://wiki.ros.org/Sensors}

For the best experience, consider purchasing supported accessories from Clearpath Robotics for your Warthog, which will include simulation, visualization, and driver support.  However, we will happily help you get started with integrating your own devices as well.

\section{Maintenance}

\subsection{Battery \& Charging}

\subsubsection{General}

Warthog contains 48V lead-acid or lithium-ion battery packs. Each battery pack consists of four 12V lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries.

Battery configuration may vary with each unit. In order to maximize performance it is important to ensure that the battery level across each set of lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries is within 0.1-0.2V of each other. If the battery packs exceed this tolerance, it is advised to charge them to within tolerance before wiring these packs
in parallel. The overall battery life will vary depending upon the usage of the unit.

Always exercise caution and observe the following safety practices connecting, disconnecting or handling batteries:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
  \item Batteries are high voltage, high current
  \item Battery packs must be properly fastened down to ensure they do not move when the Warthog is in operation.
  \item Ensure that the battery packs are evenly distributed throughout the Warthog to maximize stability.
  \item Battery levels on the unit should be checked on a regular basis.  It is important to maintain the battery voltage at a suitable level for proper operation.
  \item When additional battery packs are added to the system it is important to connect the positive terminal first to the main power of the Warthog before connecting ground.
  \item When installing additional battery packs, disconnect the ground on all battery packs presently in the unit before connecting the positive terminal of the new battery packs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Long-term Storage}

When storing Warthog for long periods of time, its important to properly maintain the batteries to fully maximize their life.  Consider one of the following two procedures when placing Warthog in long-term storage:

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep]
  \item Fully charge Warthog, turn it off and put it into storage.  Once a week, connect power to the charger and allow the charger to top up the battery for an hour or so.
  \item Fully charge Warthog, turn it off and put it into storage, but leave the charger connected and powered the entire time Warthog is in storage.  The charger will monitor the battery and will automatically charge it up as needed.
\end{itemize}


Please contact Clearpath Robotics for additional information about Warthog's battery pack.

\subsection{Tread Upgrade}
If your unit came equipped with the tread upgrade, please keep the following considerations in mind

\begin{itemize}
\item The tread drive units pull considerably more current to operate. It is advised to operate a tread Warthog at reduced speeds, either through ROS commands or by reducing the speed scale when operating with the Futaba controller.
\item Due to the increased drive current, expect lower battery life than a wheeled Warthog. It is recommend to drive at reduced speeds to increase battery life.
\item It is possible to trigger an over current error in the motor controller by increasing speed drastically shortly after resetting a stop condition. The system's body lights will seem as if the unit is ready to drive, however it will not respond to drive commands. To clear this state, simply cycle another stop condition, and ramp up speeds slower.
\end{itemize}
